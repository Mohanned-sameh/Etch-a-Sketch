# Etch-a-Sketch
# create 16x16 div elements
# center them and justify them in a flexbox in css file to be in the middle of the page
# control margins and borders to size my grid
# add a event listener on the div elements to know when a mouse goes in and goes out
# add a function to change the colors of the div elements where the mouse have clicked in them
# add a class to change the div color or make a script to change the background color of the 16x16 gird
# a popup to know how big the wanted grid to be 
# changing the value of the grid to match the given size from the popup
